# Code_Clause_Image_Caption_Generator
This is an Image Caption Generator that uses a Deep Learning model to generate captions for images. The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequence generation. The code is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow library.
